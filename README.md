# Docfish

Experimental site generator for multilingual documentation. Markdown and i18n to the bone.

[Docfish](https://github.com/lxbarth/docfish) is a multilingual site generator for narrative documentation. The Docfish philosophy is that docs should be **multilingual, easy to contribute to and easy to lift from**.

- Multilingual ([because](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers))
- Markdown-only documents (this is robust, portable and easy to edit anywhere)
- Very simple document structure

## Use

    # Build - run in your site's directory
    ./docfish
    # Outputs a _docfish/_site/ directory with the built HTML site
    # See example/ directory for a sample site.
